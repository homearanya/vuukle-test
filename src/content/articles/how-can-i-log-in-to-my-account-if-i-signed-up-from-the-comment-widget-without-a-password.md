## What if I want to log in with a password?

If you didn't set up a password, forgotten it, or simply don't know what is it, you can retrieve and reset it by clicking the "Forgot Password" link on Vuukle's Login Page. [Click here for the tutorial](https://docs.vuukle.com/how-can-i-log-in-if-i-have-forgotten-or-dont-know-my-password/)
