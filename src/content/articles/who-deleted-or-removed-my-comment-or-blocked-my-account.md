## **Vuukle does not have control in moderating and rejecting any comments**

Vuukle doesn't take part in any moderation decisions for approving, deleting, or handling disputes between commenters. We cannot provide information as to why a comment was sent to moderation or rejected. These decisions are made by the site's moderator.

## **How To Contact a Site Moderator**

Most websites has a contact page or simply search for this keyword on google: "<website's name> contact us" Unfortunately, if the website doesn't provide contact information, Vuukle won't be able to provide the contact details of the site's moderator or put you in contact with them.
