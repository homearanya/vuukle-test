You can copy the URL of any comment. When the URL is clicked on or accessed, it will load the direct comment on the website

1. Click "Share" on the comment, click the "link" icon
2. Copy the link / URL from the pop-up window
3. Paste the URL on a browser

When the URL is accessed, the website loads directly to the comment
