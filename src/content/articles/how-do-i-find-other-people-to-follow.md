Aside from following users from discussions or viewing someone else's profile, here are a couple of other ways to find other people to follow:

1. **Your Follower List** - when people follow you, you can follow them back. Read this article: [Where can I view people that follow me?](https://docs.vuukle.com/where-can-i-view-people-that-follow-me/)
2. **Your Notifications** - when people react or reply to a comment you've made, you will receive a notification with a link to that person's profile. Read this article: [Where can I see all my notifications?](https://docs.vuukle.com/where-can-i-see-all-my-notifications/)
3. **Suggested Users** - in your Vuukle account, you can find a list of suggested users that you may be interested to follow. Click a user view their profile, or click "load more" to see more suggested users.
