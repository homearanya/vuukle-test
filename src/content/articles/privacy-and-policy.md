                Vuukle is an audience engagement platform that provides engagement solutions to publishers to help increase engagement. We provide solutions like:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A power bar that helps count the number of shares and likes an article receives when user clicks on them. It is displayed at the top of the page to capture engagement.</li>
                <li>We provide a sentiment solution, popularly known as WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? that can be easily placed anywhere on the page to help users express their sentiment towards the article they just read. It helps the publisher understand
                    how many people felt happy, sad or angry for that article.</li>
                <li>We also provide commenting solutions that is placed at the bottom of the article to build community engagement where users are allowed to express their opinion relating to the article by maintaining decent conversations.</li>
            </ol>
