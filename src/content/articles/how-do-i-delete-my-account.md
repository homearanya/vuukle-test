Before deleting an account, it is important to know that all comments, replies, and other activities will be deleted from our system and cannot be recovered. You may sign up again with the same email address, but previous activities will not be recovered.

To delete your account,

1. [Log in to your Vuukle account](https://news.vuukle.com)
2. Select "Settings" from the avatar dropdown at the top right corner of the screen
3. Click the "Account" tab from the left hand panel
4. Click "Delete" Account"
5. Enter your account password (if you've signed up from the comment widget without a password, you can retrieve and reset the password, [click here for the tutorial](https://docs.vuukle.com/how-can-i-log-in-if-i-have-forgotten-or-dont-know-my-password/))
